# Overview
Welcome to the overview of today's code and what the purpose of it.

This dataset offers a panoramic view of Spotify's Top-50 playlists across 73 countries during the 45th week of 2023 (6th November - 12th November). Derived directly from the Spotify Official API, the dataset encapsulates a rich array of information. It includes details such as song names, artists, publication dates, and the respective countries for each track. Delving deeper, the dataset features columns dedicated to various musical aspects, providing a comprehensive exploration of the elements that contribute to the popularity and characteristics of the songs showcased on Spotify's global playlists.

The software analyzes a musicality dataset to uncover relationships between features like "Energy," "Liveness," and "Acousticness" and a song's popularity. It categorizes songs based on popularity scores and uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict popularity ranks. The process includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and training the KNN model with varying numbers of neighbors. A matplotlib graph visualizes how training and testing accuracies change with different neighbors, aiding in identifying optimal configurations. This tool offers insights into the influence of musical features on song popularity through a combination of EDA and machine learning techniques.

# Development Environment
Here are the tools that was use for my software and what each of them are and how they work.

### GitHub
>GitHub is a place where programmers store, share, and collaborate on their code, making it easier to work on big projects together and keep track of all the changes. It's like a big, organized playground for building digital stuff.

- Why I used it: to share my code and save it which helped keep track of my changes and show me when I did each change. It also allows me to share it so others like you can look at it.

### Visual Studio Code 
>Visual Studio Code is friendly, free, and smart computer program that makes writing and working with code easier, whether you're building websites, apps, games, or anything else that uses computer languages. It's like having a helpful assistant by your side as you explore the world of coding.

- Why I used it: I used this to create and run my software.

### Kaggle
Kaggle is an online platform that provides a collaborative environment for data science and machine learning. It was founded in 2010 and has since become a popular platform for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers. Kaggle offers a variety of tools and resources for individuals and teams to explore, analyze, and model datasets.

- Why I used it: I used it to obtain a free online data based to analysis\
